## Intelligent Systems Project
### 1. Evolutionary computation
- Goal : A function : f(x) = -15*sin^2⁡(2x)-(x-2)^2+160. Find the x such that f(x) is global maximum instead of local maximum. The x domain is from minus ten to plus ten. Set up the population sizes are 10, cross over rate is 0.8, and mutation rate is 0.01. In addition, the population precision is 10 bits when using binary code genetic algorithm.

### 2. Fuzzy system
- Goal : Complete fuzzy control of a microwave oven. This microwave oven has interesting features. The sensors which mounted on this microwave oven can detect temp and weight. Using fuzzy theory, it can automatically compute, get the moderate power and operation time, and heat the food according to the calculation results. These features can reduce the time when we use it to heat food. We just push a button, and the food would be heated correctly. According to the fuzzy rules and membership functions, using COG to defuzzy, and depending on the defuzzification, plot two charts.

### 3. Neural network (BP)
>
- Goal : A function is f(x, y) = 5*sⅈn⁡(πx^2 )*sⅈn(2πy)+1. The value of x and y are between -0.8 and 0.7. According to the coordinate points of this function, use backpropagation neural network to train an approximate nonlinear function model.
